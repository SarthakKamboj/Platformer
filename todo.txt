current things to do
------------------
- find spritesheet for 
    - mario
    - question box
    - brick
    - ground block
    - pipe
    - get big mushroom
    - powerful star
    - castle

- create prototype with basic rectangles and stuff (done)
- add physics components and col detection

- make types for mario and ground and do basic movement, physics, and col detection
    - possibly construct these out of smaller building blocks and keep track of indicies, also allows for separating systems easier
        1. sprite renderer 
        2. physics component
        3. collision bounding box
    - also allows each system to update at once which improves performance and means each system can update one by one and also allows for multithreading later on

overall things to do
------------------
1. find proper spritesheets (may need to make tool to standardize spritesheets)
- render mario + goomba + koopa troopas
- render background in layers
- add animations for these characters
- add aabb physics
- add audio
- maybe need to create separate tool for level design
- add more flushed out UI system
- add particle effects for breaking stuff

required systems
---------------
- rendering
- animation
- physics
- audio
- possibly level design tool
- scene manager is multiple levels are made 
- UI (research best strategy here and if a HTML/CSS template would be useful, make sure it works best for the game)
- visual effects/particle system

extra stuff
--------
- pipes that lead to different parts of the level
- boss fight
- luigi
- luigi but with networked multiplayer??
